# NEW YORK CITY PIZZA REVIEWS!!
A collection of nyc pizza reviews by Dave Portnoy!

# Usage
The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the Rails backend and React frontend. I also wanted to have an app where users can view the collection of pizza reviews by Dave since he only has videos on his webpage. I know that many people are asking if there is something out there (like a list) of his reviews. I manually collected these reviews myself and seeded it onto the Rails backend via csv file. I currently only have 63 reviews but more is coming!!

# Ruby version ---> 2.5.1
